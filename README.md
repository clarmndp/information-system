## Developer guidelines
Always take note of the following notes.
1. **NEVER directly push nor edit main.** Before coding, always create a branch from the main branch.
2. **Add comments if applicable.** A comment is recommended if you cannot understand what a code block does with just a few seconds of reading.
3. **NEVER merge pull requests automatically.**
